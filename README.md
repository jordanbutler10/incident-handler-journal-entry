# 🛡️ Ransomware Response – Incident Handler's Journal Entry

This project simulates a real-world **ransomware attack response** using an **Incident Handler's Journal** format. It documents the key details of a cyberattack that targeted a small U.S. healthcare clinic through a phishing campaign. The exercise highlights the importance of proactive defense strategies and the role of incident handlers in identifying and reporting critical events.

## 🏥 Scenario Overview

A healthcare clinic specializing in primary care services experienced a **ransomware attack** that encrypted critical systems and patient records. The attack was launched via **targeted phishing emails** that tricked employees into installing malware. Once deployed, the ransomware locked the clinic out of essential files and demanded a large payment for the decryption key.

As a security team member, I created an **Incident Handler’s Journal Entry** to document the event and reflect on the 5W’s (Who, What, When, Where, Why) of the incident.
